# Contributing to Existing Puzzles
Check the individual folder for a CONTRIBUTING.md for specific rules. If none are specified assume that improvments are welcome. Please provide detailed PR request messages to highlight what improvments were made. It may be best to discuss improvments in the issue tracker before commiting. As open source puzzling on github is relatively unexplored the contributing rules are liable to change. Please help in developing this workflow if you have ideas.
